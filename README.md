## Overview

This dissertation addresses the critical challenge of segmenting gliomas in post-treatment MRI scansâ€”a task crucial for improving clinical outcomes in brain tumor patients. By developing a novel deep learning architecture that combines residual connections and spatial attention mechanisms within a 3D U-Net framework, the research significantly enhances the differentiation between residual tumor tissue and treatment-related changes.


## Abstract

Gliomas are among the most aggressive brain tumors, and their post-treatment management is complicated by anatomical changes and treatment artifacts in MRI scans. This work introduces a **Residual 3D U-Net with Attention** that leverages deep neural networks to improve segmentation accuracy. The model is designed to capture both fine structural details and high-level contextual information, which is crucial for distinguishing between residual tumor tissue and treatment effects. The research demonstrates significant improvements in segmentation performance, validated by metrics such as the Dice Coefficient and lesion-wise sensitivity.

## Methodology

1. **Model Architecture:**
   - **Encoder:** Extracts multi-scale features using residual blocks and max-pooling.
   - **Decoder:** Utilizes transpose convolutions for upsampling and integrates encoder features via skip connections.
   - **Attention Mechanism:** Applies spatial attention to focus on the most relevant regions for segmentation.
2. **Loss Function:**  
   A combined loss function balances focal loss and cross-entropy loss to improve training stability and performance.
3. **Implementation:**  
   Detailed experimentation with learning rate schedulers and regularization techniques ensured optimal training of the network on the BraTS 2024 dataset.

## Experiments and Results

- **Dataset:**  
  Utilizes a subset of the 2024 BraTS dataset for post-treatment glioma segmentation.
- **Evaluation:**  
  The proposed model consistently achieves higher Dice scores (up to ~0.87 for whole tumor segmentation) and improved sensitivity, outperforming baseline models.
- **Visual Analysis:**  
  Qualitative results show close alignment between predicted segmentation and ground truth, particularly in delineating complex tumor boundaries and resection cavities.
